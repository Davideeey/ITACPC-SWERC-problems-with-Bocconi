Contest: Bocconi ICPC Selection, September 2025 (Kattis)
Problem: E - Jumbled Scoreboards

Problem in short:
    You receive n pictures of a scoreboard showing scores (a, b) for two teams.
    Scores for each team can only increase over time, and every pair (a, b)
    in the input is unique. The pictures are given in the order you received them.

    Output "yes" if the pictures can be in chronological order, otherwise "no".

Idea:
    If the pictures are in chronological order, then as time goes forward
    neither score can ever decrease. So for each consecutive pair
        (a_i, b_i) -> (a_{i+1}, b_{i+1})
    we must have
        a_{i+1} >= a_i and b_{i+1} >= b_i.
    We simply check this condition for all adjacent pairs.
