Contest: SWERC 2022_practice_Bocconi
Problem: H - Beppa and SwerChat

Problem in short:
    For each test case we have n and two permutations a[1..n], b[1..n]
    of member IDs 1..n. List a is the order at 9:00, list b at 22:00.
    No two members are ever online at the same time, and nobody is
    online exactly at 9:00 or 22:00. A member who never comes online
    between 9:00 and 22:00 keeps the same last-seen time, so the
    relative order between any two such members must be the same in
    both lists.

Idea:
    The members who do not come online correspond to a largest subset
    whose relative order is the same in both permutations. Mapping b's
    elements to their positions in a gives an array p[1..n]. The length
    of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of p is the maximum
    number of members that may have stayed offline. The answer is
    n minus this LIS length.
